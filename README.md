ByteDistillers Payment
======================

The primary goal of this project is to make it easier to attach payment provider APIs to Java-based applications.

This is done by providing a set of templates which are designed to work like those already known from diverse SpringSource projects.

For further information, please check out the according subdirectories. You will find the documentation and sourcecode for the specific APIs there.
